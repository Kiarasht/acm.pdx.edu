About this File:
Add to this page if you have an idea, it doesn't even have to be a good.
Think of this more as a suggestion box for what should be done with the site.
That way if someone has the time them they can hack away and get something done without wondering what to do.
If something needs to be done, just say so here.
If it needs to be done now, then yell at someone who can do what needs to be done through email or something, but maybe also write it down here if you want to make sure they have the instructions.
