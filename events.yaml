    Connecting Android to MySQL: An Interactive Tutorial
  date: 10-18-2013
  speaker: Sean Walsh (IRC:Azadi)
  description: |
    In this talk, we will cover the basics of how to connect an Android device to a MySQL database. The technique used is adaptable to any database server (SQL Server, PostGRES, etc...)

    As you probably know, Android does not have a built in functionality to access remote databases, instead it uses SQLLite, a flat file system.

    However, using Java EE 7 and a simple PHP connectivity script, it is practically trivial to do the basic CRUD operations on a remotely hosted database.

    Bring a laptop with Java 7 and Android SDK with Eclipse installed, and get ready to code. Or just bring yourself, and a sheet will be passed to have the connection code EMAILED to you after the venue.<br />

    About the speaker: Sean Walsh (IRC:Azadi) is the current chair of the Portland State Chapter of the ACM. Sean is currently finishing his Bachelor's of Computer Science with a Mathematics Minor at Portland State University, and has industry experience with deploying mobile apps for Android.

-  title: Text Lacks Empathy
   date: 5-24-2013
   speaker: Nóirín Plunkett

     Have you ever written a nice friendly email and gotten a reply that seems like they read a whole different email?

     In Open Source communities we write to each other all the time, but we.re not really writing, we're speaking with our fingers. Text is our primary way to communicate, but text has problems. Speaking conveys subtle emotional cues that as social animals we rely on; text strips them out. A thoughtful correspondent can put those emotions back, but we're often not thoughtful.

     This talk is about the special problems of textual communication: mitigating them; ensuring that what you mean to say is what is understood; interpreting messages that seem totally out of whack; and increasing empathic bandwidth.
