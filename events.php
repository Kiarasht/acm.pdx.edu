    <!--<p>Friday (1/18/2013) in FAB 86-01 we will have guest speaker Michael Schern presenting Git For Ages 4 And Up.</p>

    <p>Synopsis: Tinker Toys are the best illustration of a Git repository I've found. Side-by-side with issuing Git commands, 
    we'll build a Git repository out of kid's toys to show what's going on behind the scenes. 
    Mind bending concepts like remote branches, rebase and the staging area become child.s play.<br />
    <br />
    Basic knowledge of git commands is expected of the audience (init, add, commit, diff, log, push, pull).
    If you.ve started using git, but are uncomfortable with it and don.t really get it, this is for you.<br />

    <!--<p>This Friday (1/25/2013):<br /> What I've learned about finding the right IT job by Gabrielle Roth from EnterpriseDB.</p>

    <p>Synopsis:</p>

    <p>Ah, the IT department:  Strange coworkers, on-call rotations, no budget
for new equipment, and the grim realities of "consultant vs employee".
 We'll cover these and a few other situations you can expect to
encounter, and potential coping methods.  Of course, before we can
consider all that, you have to actually have a job - so we'll also talk
about ways to make your job hunt more successful:  what's worked for me,
what's worked for my friends, and (more importantly) what hasn't.</p>

<p>About the Speaker:</p>

<p>Gabrielle started out her post-college life as a microbiologist and fell
into IT by way of technical writing.  15 or so years later, she still
occasionally wonders what exactly she got herself into, but overall
she's having a good time.  Currently, she's a Systems Engineer with
EnterpriseDB, a PostgreSQL company.</p>-->

Collaborative chaos: what it means to write code, manage projects and work with people in open source communities</p>
<p>SUMMARY<br />
Working in software and with computers means wildly different things depending on who you talk to. In open source, the work spans every aspect of software development - from the marketing and documentation to the troubleshooting end-user systems.</p>
<p>The "community manager" or "organizer" role in open source communities is probably the least-well defined in our industry, but is seen as a crucial part of open source software development. </p>
<p>Selena will talk about her work as a serial user group starter, open source conference circuit speaker, conference organizer and contributor to PostgreSQL - all roles considered part of community management. She'll also talk about other kinds of community management roles available at small and large companies, or as a volunteer in an open source project. </p>
<p>SHORT BIO<br />
Selena is a major contributor to PostgreSQL, she founded and runs the Postgres Open conference and keeps chickens. Selena has been working with open source software for over 15 years.She's keynoted at SCALE, DjangoCon and LISA, and regularly gives technical talks about Postgres, open source and trolling. She is currently a data architect at Mozilla, makers of the Firefox browser.</p>-->

Challenges in Developing the Portal Transportation Data Archive<br />

of Portland and Vancouver) to produce a web site that is useful in their
day-to-day operations.<br />
<br />

Kristin Tufte is an assistant professor of Computer Science and Civil
Engineering at Portland State University. Kristin is a recovering
