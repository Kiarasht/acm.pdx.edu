ACM Challenge: 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create the awesomest, 
fastest, most badass Scrabble AI. 
    Your first task is to create a program that takes a scrabble test file from
standard in and then outputs a scrabble move to standard out. 

You can find example test files from the testcases/ subfolder. 
    Your output should look like this:

scrbl_move: (tiles_used) (ROW, COL, word_played, EAST | SOUTH)

See examples/ for more examples. 

You must use the Official Scrabble Player's 2nd Edition dictionary. It is in
dict/OSPDv2.txt. 

The layout for a Scrabble Board (where the double word / double letter / 
triple word / triple letter bonuses are) can be easily found online. For 
convenience, there's a text file at data/layout.txt with this layout. 

test_all.sh : Test your program to see if it's correct and what score you got. 
    Usage <test_all.sh "command to run your program">

test_one.sh : Test your program on one test file. 
    Usage <test_one.sh "command to run your program" "testfile">
